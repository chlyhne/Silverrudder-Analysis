This document summarizes pace deltas (minutes per NM) by leg.
\fi
\paragraph{Purpose.}
The purpose of this report is to give skippers a practical tool for evaluating and analyzing their performance in Silverrudder 2025. By comparing each boat to a common baseline at the same \emph{place} on the course (progress along the rhumb line), the plots highlight where time was gained or lost on each leg and where performance was stable versus inconsistent.
\paragraph{How to read.}
Each leg figure shows, for every boat, the distribution of per-sample \emph{pace delta} relative to the fleet mean pace at the same \emph{progress} along the rhumb line (average route). Negative values mean a boat was faster than the baseline (lower minutes per NM), while positive values mean slower. The box spans the interquartile range (25--75\%), the horizontal line is the median, and the dot is the mean; whiskers show the full min/max observed within that leg. \ifspeedplots Each leg section includes both pace and speed delta plots; the box plot anatomy is the same, but speed deltas are reported in knots.\fi
\paragraph{Definitions (speed, pace, and mean pace).}
The input data contains a \emph{speed} sample for each GPS record (after unit conversion to knots, $\mathrm{kn}$).
\emph{Pace} is the inverse representation: minutes per nautical mile. For each sample,
\[
\mathrm{pace}\,[\mathrm{min}/\mathrm{NM}] = \frac{60}{v\,[\mathrm{kn}]}.
\]
For example, $6.0\,\mathrm{kn} \Rightarrow 10.00\,\mathrm{min}/\mathrm{NM}$ and $5.0\,\mathrm{kn} \Rightarrow 12.00\,\mathrm{min}/\mathrm{NM}$.
\paragraph{Why pace (not speed).}
Pace is directly ``time per distance'', which makes it easier to reason about where time is gained or lost along the course. Because pace is the inverse of speed,
\[
\mathrm{pace}=\frac{60}{v},
\]
the relationship is nonlinear: the same speed change costs more minutes per nautical mile when the boat is already slow. Example: $6\,\mathrm{kn}\rightarrow 5\,\mathrm{kn}$ changes pace from $10.00$ to $12.00\,\mathrm{min}/\mathrm{NM}$ (+2.00), while $3\,\mathrm{kn}\rightarrow 2\,\mathrm{kn}$ changes pace from $20.00$ to $30.00\,\mathrm{min}/\mathrm{NM}$ (+10.00). Those extra minutes per mile add up directly into finish-time differences. Expressing performance as pace deltas highlights the locations where time is being lost, even when boats pass those locations at different times.
\emph{Mean pace} in this report refers to a \emph{baseline} computed at a given location along the course: all boat samples are first projected to the rhumb line (average route) to obtain progress, then within a local progress window the per-sample paces are averaged to form a mean pace curve versus progress (and lightly smoothed along progress). Note that ``mean pace'' is \emph{not} the same as converting the mean speed, because inversion is nonlinear: in general $\overline{(60/v)} \neq 60/\overline{v}$.
\paragraph{Pace delta.}
For each boat sample, the plotted value is
\[
\Delta \mathrm{pace} = \mathrm{pace}_{\mathrm{boat}} - \mathrm{pace}_{\mathrm{mean}}(\mathrm{progress}).
\]
Negative $\Delta\mathrm{pace}$ means faster-than-baseline at that point on the course (lower minutes per NM), while positive means slower-than-baseline.
\ifspeedplots
\paragraph{Speed delta.}
For each boat sample, the plotted value is
\[
\Delta \mathrm{Speed} = \mathrm{Speed}_{\mathrm{boat}} - \mathrm{Speed}_{\mathrm{mean}}(\mathrm{progress}).
\]
Positive $\Delta\mathrm{Speed}$ means faster-than-baseline at that point on the course (higher $\mathrm{kn}$), while negative means slower-than-baseline.
\fi
\paragraph{High-level observations.}
Use the plot shapes as direct diagnostics:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Sign:} a mean dot or median line \emph{below} $0$ means faster-than-baseline at the same place on the course; \emph{above} $0$ means slower-than-baseline.
\item \textbf{Consistency:} a short box (small IQR) means the boat stayed close to a single pace delta through the leg; a tall box means the pace delta moved around a lot within the leg.
\item \textbf{Time leaks:} a long upper whisker (large positive deltas) means the boat had patches where it was dramatically slower than the baseline at specific locations; those patches dominate time lost on that leg.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Leg 1: Start-Troense}

\caption{Speed delta by boat for leg 1.}
\end{figure}
\fi
\paragraph{What stands out.}
This leg contains a large start-phase effect. The wide spread is driven by late starters and congestion: when a boat is still stuck in the start pack (very low speed), its pace increases sharply and produces large positive $\Delta\mathrm{pace}$ outliers. Boats that clear the start line and traffic quickly produce distributions closer to $0$ (or below), while boats delayed in congestion show long positive tails that mostly represent start delay rather than steady sailing performance.

\section*{Leg 2: Troense-Thuro Rev}

\caption{Speed delta by boat for leg 2.}
\end{figure}
\fi
\paragraph{What stands out.}
Compared to leg 1, the distributions are tighter: many boats sit closer to $0$ and the boxes are shorter. Boats that remain clearly offset from $0$ through this leg are carrying a persistent advantage or disadvantage at the same places on the course (not a single isolated incident).
\sectionbreak
\section*{Leg 3: Thuro Rev-Storebaeltsbroen}
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Speed delta by boat for leg 3.}
\end{figure}
\fi
\paragraph{What stands out.}
This is a compression leg: many boats sit close to $0$ and the main differentiator is consistency. A narrow box means the boat stayed close to its typical pace delta through the leg; a long positive whisker means the boat had brief but very costly slowdowns at specific places.
\sectionbreak
\section*{Leg 4: Storebaeltsbroen-Fynshoved}
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Speed delta by boat for leg 4.}
\end{figure}
\fi
\paragraph{What stands out.}
The slow side shows the important structure: when a boat's box lies mostly above $0$, the boat is slower than the baseline through most of the leg. When the upper whisker extends far above the box, the boat has a small number of locations where it loses a large amount of time per mile relative to the baseline.
\sectionbreak
\section*{Leg 5: Fynshoved-Aebelo}
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics{figures/\figurevariant/pace-delta-leg-05-fynshoved-aebelo.pdf}

\caption{Speed delta by boat for leg 5.}
\end{figure}
\fi
\paragraph{What stands out.}
This leg shows clearer separation: boats spread further away from $0$ and the slow side shows larger spreads for some boats. When a boat has a high median \emph{and} a tall box, the boat is slower than baseline most of the time and also inconsistent within the leg; that combination produces large cumulative time loss.
\sectionbreak
\section*{Leg 6: Aebelo-Strib Fyr}
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics{figures/\figurevariant/speed-delta-leg-06-aebelo-strib-fyr.pdf}
\caption{Speed delta by boat for leg 6.}
\end{figure}
\fi
\paragraph{What stands out.}
This leg separates boats into a faster group (negative deltas) and a slower group (positive deltas). Within each group, compare spreads: two boats have similar medians, but the boat with the narrower box is the boat with fewer large deviations from its typical pace delta through the leg.
\sectionbreak
\section*{Leg 7: Strib Fyr-Snaevringen}
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
\fi
\paragraph{What stands out.}
This leg makes it easy to spot both speed and reliability. Boats with boxes centered below $0$ are faster-than-baseline; boats with boxes centered above $0$ are slower-than-baseline. A tight box with one long positive whisker points to a specific slow patch: most of the leg was fine, but one location produced a large time loss.
\sectionbreak
\section*{Leg 8: Snaevringen-Bogo}

\caption{Speed delta by boat for leg 8.}
\end{figure}
\fi
\paragraph{What stands out.}
This leg shows the same two ingredients: offset from $0$ (faster or slower) and spread (stable or variable). Boats that combine a negative center and a narrow box are fast \emph{and} steady; boats that combine a positive center and a tall box are slow \emph{and} inconsistent.

\section*{Leg 9: Bogo-Horneland}

\caption{Speed delta by boat for leg 9.}
\end{figure}
\fi
\paragraph{What stands out.}
Look for boats with boxes centered far from $0$: those are persistent advantages or disadvantages at the same places on the course. Wide boxes here signal variable performance across the leg, while tight boxes point to steady execution.
\sectionbreak
\section*{Leg 10: Horneland-Lehnskov}
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
\fi
\paragraph{What stands out.}
This leg rewards consistency: the median shows overall offset from the baseline, while long whiskers flag isolated slowdowns that can dominate time lost.
\sectionbreak
\section*{Leg 11: Lehnskov-Finish}
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics{figures/\figurevariant/pace-delta-leg-11-lehnskov-finish.pdf}

\includegraphics{figures/\figurevariant/speed-delta-leg-11-lehnskov-finish.pdf}
\caption{Speed delta by boat for leg 11.}
\end{figure}
\fi
\paragraph{What stands out.}
This closing leg contains the largest slow outliers in the set of plots: some boats have long positive tails. Those tails correspond to locations where the boat spent substantial time at low speed, which drives pace upward (minutes per mile). Boats with a strong slow tail in this leg have a small set of places that dominate their total time loss on the run back to Finish.
