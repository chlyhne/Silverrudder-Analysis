\section*{Overview}
This document summarizes pace deltas (minutes per NM) by leg.
\paragraph{How to read.}
Each leg figure shows, for every boat, the distribution of per-sample \emph{pace delta} relative to the fleet mean pace at the same \emph{progress} along the rhumb line (average route). Negative values mean a boat was faster than the baseline (lower minutes per NM), while positive values mean slower. The box spans the interquartile range (25--75\%), the horizontal line is the median, and the dot is the mean; whiskers show the full min/max observed within that leg.
\paragraph{Definitions (speed, pace, and mean pace).}
The input data contains a \emph{speed} sample for each GPS record (after unit conversion to knots, $\mathrm{kn}$).
\emph{Pace} is the inverse representation: minutes per nautical mile. For each sample,
\[
\mathrm{pace}\,[\mathrm{min}/\mathrm{NM}] = \frac{60}{v\,[\mathrm{kn}]}.
\]
For example, $6.0\,\mathrm{kn} \Rightarrow 10.00\,\mathrm{min}/\mathrm{NM}$ and $5.0\,\mathrm{kn} \Rightarrow 12.00\,\mathrm{min}/\mathrm{NM}$.
\emph{Mean pace} in this report refers to a \emph{baseline} computed at a given location along the course: all boat samples are first projected to the rhumb line (average route) to obtain progress, then within a local progress window the per-sample paces are averaged to form a mean pace curve versus progress (and lightly smoothed along progress). Note that ``mean pace'' is \emph{not} the same as converting the mean speed, because inversion is nonlinear: in general $\overline{(60/v)} \neq 60/\overline{v}$.
\paragraph{Pace delta.}
For each boat sample, the plotted value is
\[
\Delta \mathrm{pace} = \mathrm{pace}_{\mathrm{boat}} - \mathrm{pace}_{\mathrm{mean}}(\mathrm{progress}).
\]
Negative $\Delta\mathrm{pace}$ means faster-than-baseline at that point on the course (lower minutes per NM), while positive means slower-than-baseline.
\paragraph{High-level observations.}
Leg 1 shows the largest early separation, legs 2--4 are comparatively tight (small spreads), and legs 9--10 are the most volatile with very large slow outliers for some boats. Across multiple legs, \emph{Nordri} and \emph{Mercutio} frequently appear among the fastest boats by mean pace delta, while \emph{Gladys} is often among the slowest.

\section*{Leg 1: Start-Thuro Rev}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pace-delta-leg-01-start-thuro-rev.pdf}
\caption{Pace delta by boat for leg 1.}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Summary.}
Mean pace deltas range from -2.71 to +5.67 min/NM (median +0.06). Median IQR across boats is 5.50 min/NM. Fastest (lowest mean): Nordri (-2.71); Samba (-2.03); My (-1.86). Slowest (highest mean): Gladys (+5.67); Saga (+4.09); Lets Sea (+3.28).
\paragraph{Interpretation.}
This is a highly differentiating opening leg with a very wide spread in both mean deltas and within-boat variability, indicating that boats separated early in the race relative to the fleet baseline.

\section*{Leg 2: Thuro Rev-GB Bridge}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pace-delta-leg-02-thuro-rev-gb-bridge.pdf}
\caption{Pace delta by boat for leg 2.}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Summary.}
Mean pace deltas range from -1.29 to +1.22 min/NM (median -0.27). Median IQR across boats is 1.52 min/NM. Fastest (lowest mean): Mercutio (-1.29); Moana (-1.22); My (-1.21). Slowest (highest mean): Gladys (+1.22); Sweet Escape (+0.96); Lets Sea (+0.69).
\paragraph{Interpretation.}
The clustering is much tighter than leg 1: smaller spreads suggest a more uniform performance baseline and fewer large deviations within this segment.
\clearpage
\section*{Leg 3: GB Bridge-Fynshoved}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pace-delta-leg-03-gb-bridge-fynshoved.pdf}
\caption{Pace delta by boat for leg 3.}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Summary.}
Mean pace deltas range from -0.54 to +0.34 min/NM (median -0.10). Median IQR across boats is 1.00 min/NM. Fastest (lowest mean): Nordri (-0.54); Chaya (-0.24); Moana (-0.16). Slowest (highest mean): Gladys (+0.34); Lets Sea (+0.25); Vera (+0.16).
\paragraph{Interpretation.}
This is one of the tightest legs overall: low ranges and low IQRs indicate that the fleet stayed relatively close to the baseline pace here.
\clearpage
\section*{Leg 4: Fynshoved-Aebelo}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pace-delta-leg-04-fynshoved-aebelo.pdf}
\caption{Pace delta by boat for leg 4.}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Summary.}
Mean pace deltas range from -0.35 to +0.68 min/NM (median -0.08). Median IQR across boats is 1.03 min/NM. Fastest (lowest mean): Julia (-0.35); Saga (-0.30); Samba (-0.26). Slowest (highest mean): Sweet Escape (+0.68); Lets Sea (+0.58); Gladys (+0.42).
\paragraph{Interpretation.}
Still a relatively tight leg, but with clearer separation at the slow end; the slowest boats show consistently positive deltas (slower-than-baseline pace) throughout this segment.
\clearpage
\section*{Leg 5: Aebelo-Striib Fyr}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pace-delta-leg-05-aebelo-striib-fyr.pdf}
\caption{Pace delta by boat for leg 5.}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Summary.}
Mean pace deltas range from -0.62 to +1.65 min/NM (median +0.14). Median IQR across boats is 1.81 min/NM. Fastest (lowest mean): Nordri (-0.62); Vera (-0.44); Samba (-0.32). Slowest (highest mean): Gladys (+1.65); Chaya (+1.22); Lets Sea (+0.69).
\paragraph{Interpretation.}
The spread increases again: several boats are consistently faster than the baseline (negative deltas), while the slowest boats show larger positive deltas and wider variability.
\clearpage
\section*{Leg 6: Striib Fyr-Snaevringen}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pace-delta-leg-06-striib-fyr-snaevringen.pdf}
\caption{Pace delta by boat for leg 6.}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Summary.}
Mean pace deltas range from -1.66 to +1.39 min/NM (median -0.60). Median IQR across boats is 2.03 min/NM. Fastest (lowest mean): Nordri (-1.66); Aegir 2.0 (-1.26); Saga (-1.22). Slowest (highest mean): Gladys (+1.39); Lets Sea (+0.92); Sweet Escape (+0.61).
\paragraph{Interpretation.}
This leg is more differentiating than legs 2--4, with clear separation between the fastest group (more negative deltas) and the slowest group (positive deltas).
\clearpage
\section*{Leg 7: Snaevringen-Bogo}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pace-delta-leg-07-snaevringen-bogo.pdf}
\caption{Pace delta by boat for leg 7.}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Summary.}
Mean pace deltas range from -1.63 to +2.28 min/NM (median -0.27). Median IQR across boats is 2.15 min/NM. Fastest (lowest mean): Mercutio (-1.63); Saga (-0.94); My (-0.74). Slowest (highest mean): Gladys (+2.28); Chaya (+1.06); Sweet Escape (+0.85).
\paragraph{Interpretation.}
The fastest boats are clearly separated by mean pace delta, while wider boxes for some boats indicate higher within-leg variability (inconsistent deviation from the baseline).
\clearpage
\section*{Leg 8: Bogo-Helnaes}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pace-delta-leg-08-bogo-helnaes.pdf}
\caption{Pace delta by boat for leg 8.}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Summary.}
Mean pace deltas range from -1.75 to +1.86 min/NM (median -0.35). Median IQR across boats is 2.17 min/NM. Fastest (lowest mean): Mercutio (-1.75); My (-1.49); Moana (-0.80). Slowest (highest mean): Gladys (+1.86); Sweet Escape (+0.86); Chaya (+0.46).
\paragraph{Interpretation.}
Similar to leg 7, this segment shows a sustained advantage for the fastest boats, with meaningful separation between the top and bottom of the fleet.
\clearpage
\section*{Leg 9: Helnaes-Lehnskov}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pace-delta-leg-09-helnaes-lehnskov.pdf}
\caption{Pace delta by boat for leg 9.}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Summary.}
Mean pace deltas range from -4.03 to +15.87 min/NM (median -2.03). Median IQR across boats is 4.33 min/NM. Fastest (lowest mean): My (-4.03); Mercutio (-3.75); Aegir 2.0 (-3.50). Slowest (highest mean): Sweet Escape (+15.87); Gladys (+10.55); Lets Sea (+4.24).
\paragraph{Interpretation.}
This leg is extremely volatile and dominates the slow-end outliers: very large positive means suggest some boats spent substantial time far slower than the fleet baseline within this segment.
\clearpage
\section*{Leg 10: Lehnskov-Finish}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pace-delta-leg-10-lehnskov-finish.pdf}
\caption{Pace delta by boat for leg 10.}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Summary.}
Mean pace deltas range from -5.10 to +14.73 min/NM (median -1.85). Median IQR across boats is 6.02 min/NM. Fastest (lowest mean): Moana (-5.10); Vera (-4.46); Mercutio (-3.05). Slowest (highest mean): Aegir 2.0 (+14.73); Julia (+5.36); Saga (+3.86).
\paragraph{Interpretation.}
The final leg is also highly differentiating, with large positive outliers on the slow end and a clearly faster front group by mean pace delta.
